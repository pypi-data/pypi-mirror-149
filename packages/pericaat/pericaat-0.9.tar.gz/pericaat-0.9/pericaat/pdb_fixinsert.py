"""
Fixes insertion codes in a PDB file.
Works by deleting an insertion code and shifting the residue numbering of
downstream residues. Allows for picking specific residues to delete insertion
codes for.
Usage:
    python pdb_fixinsert.py [-<option>] <pdb file>
Example:
    python pdb_fixinsert.py 1CTF.pdb  # delete ALL insertion codes
    python pdb_fixinsert.py -A9,B12 1CTF.pdb  # deletes ins. codes for res
                                              # 9 of chain A and 12 of chain B.
This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.

    Delete insertion codes (at specific residues).
    By default, removes ALL insertion codes on ALL residues. Also bumps
    the residue numbering of residues downstream of each insertion.
    This function is a generator.
    Parameters
    ----------
    fhandle : a line-by-line iterator of the original PDB file.
    option_list : list
        List of insertion options to act on.
        Example ["A9", "B12"]. An empty list performs the default
        action.
    Yields
    ------
    str (line-by-line)
        The modified (or not) PDB line.
