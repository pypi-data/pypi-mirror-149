# these are available during all three stages (decisions, distributions, equations)
definitions:
    - from numpy import log, maximum
    - from jax.experimental.host_callback import id_print as jax_print

variables: [Div, Y, Yprod, w, pi, Rn, Rs, R, Rstar, Tax, Z, beta, vphi, C, L, B, Top10C, Top10A]
distributions:
  D: # a distribution named 'D'
    # ordering matters because it is the same ordering as the axis of all distribution variables
    e: # dim0
      type: exogenous
      grid_variables: [e_grid, e_stationary, e_tmat] # returns e_grid, e_stationary, e_tmat
      rho: 0.966
      sigma: 0.5
      # alternatively: if the previous 3 are not defined here, it is assumed that the grid_variables are available during the distribution stage (as an output of 'decisions')
      n: 4
    a: # dim1
      type: endogenous
      grid_variables: a_grid # a variable named a_grid will be made available during decisions calls and distributions calls
      min: 0.0
      max: 150
      n: 100

decisions: # stage one
  inputs: [VaPrime] # additional to all aggregated variables defined in 'variables'
  calls:
    # these are executed subsequently, starting with the latest in time T. Each call takes the previous outputs as given
    ~ T = transfers(e_stationary, Div, Tax, e_grid)
    ~ we = wages(w, e_grid)
    ~ VaPrimeExp = e_tmat @ VaPrime
    ~ Va, a, c, n = hh(VaPrimeExp, a_grid, we, T, R, beta, eis, frisch, vphi)
    ~ ne = labor_supply(n, e_grid)
  outputs: [a,c,ne] # those are the ones stored for the following stages

# stage two: finding distributions via forward calls. This is done automatically using the information provided in 'distributions'
# inputs are all grid_variables and, for endogenous distribution variables, variables named like the members of 'distributions' (e.g. 'a')
# outputs are the distribution(s) named as define in 'distributions' (e.g. here 'D')

# stage three (optional): aux_equations
# these can contain misc definitions that are available during the final stage.
# outputs from decisions, the grid variables, the distributions and
# aggregate variables from 'variables' (including those with "Prime", "Lag",...) are included by default
# from here on the objects are _sequences_ with shapes either (1, horizon) or (n1, n2, horizon). Last dimension is always the time dimension
aux_equations:
    ~ A = np.sum(D*a, axis=(0,1)) # note that we are summing over the first two dimensions e and a, but not the time dimension (dimension 2)
    ~ NE = np.sum(D*ne, axis=(0,1))
    ~ aggr_c = np.sum(D*c, axis=(0,1))
    # calculate consumption share of top-10% cumsumers
    ~ c_flat = c.reshape(-1,c.shape[-1]) # consumption flattend for each t
    ~ dist_sorted_c = jnp.take_along_axis(D.reshape(-1,c.shape[-1]), jnp.argsort(c_flat, axis=0), axis=0) # distribution sorted after consumption level, flattend for each t
    ~ top10c = jnp.where(jnp.cumsum(dist_sorted_c, axis=0) > .9, c_flat, 0.).sum(0)/c_flat.sum(axis=0) # must use `where` for jax. All sums must be taken over the non-time axis
    # calculate wealth share of top-10% wealth holders
    ~ a_flat = a.reshape(-1,a.shape[-1]) # assets flattend for each t
    ~ dist_sorted_a = jnp.take_along_axis(D.reshape(-1,a.shape[-1]), jnp.argsort(a_flat, axis=0), axis=0) # as above ...
    ~ top10a = jnp.where(jnp.cumsum(dist_sorted_a, axis=0) > .9, a_flat, 0.).sum(0)/a_flat.sum(axis=0)
