# agoradesk_py
Python interface for [AgoraDesk.com/LocalMonero.co API](https://agoradesk.com/api-docs/v1).

This is currently not a complete implementation of the Agoradesk API.

The following API calls are currently **not** supported.

**I offer no warranty of any kind -- use this at your own risk!**

*I am not associated with AgoraDesk.com or LocalMonero.co.*

# Requirements:
The two main requirements are [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) and [arrow](https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
I am using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) with this project to keep track of dependencies / requirements.

# Install

`pip install agoradesk_py`

# How to Use
This is an example about how you can use the library

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from agoradesk_py.agoradesk import AgoraDesk

api_key = <YourAPIKey>

api = AgoraDesk(api_key)

# Get information about all released trades
api_response = api.dashboard_released()

if api_response["success"]:
    trades = api_response["response"]["data"]["contact_list"]

    for trade in trades:
        trade_data = trade["data"]
        print(
            f"Traded "
            f"{trade_data['amount_xmr']} XMR with a fee of {trade_data['fee_xmr']} XMR "
            f"for {trade_data['amount']} {trade_data['currency']} "
            f"on {trade_data['released_at']}"
        )

else:
     print(f"Error: {api_response['response']['error']}")

```

# Running Tests
**Please be aware of the unauthenticated API requests limit of 20 req/h**

Tests are split into Unit tests and integration tests.

To prepare to run any tests:
1) Clone this repository to your computer.
2) Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
3) Install all dependencies / requirements for agoradesk_py using the command `poetry install` in the project directory.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests do not communicate with LocalMonero / AgoraDesk and are executed entirely locally.

Running all unit tests with coverage report is as easy as using the command
`poetry run pytest --cov-report term-missing tests/unit/` in the project directory,

## Integration Tests

Integration tests communicate with the actual LocalMonero / AgoraDesk production APIs and the tests depend on
the two following environment variables being set to the api_keys of two testing accounts at LocalMonero.co.
* api_key
* api_key2

Please be aware that:
* LocalMonero.co or AgoraDesk.com are not currently providing a testing setup and all testes are running in their production environment.
* For some tests to run successfully the account for `api_key2` needs to have a balance of currently about 0.1 XMR
* The two testing account need to be set to trust each other for all the tests to be successful.

To run the integration tests use the command `poetry run pytest tests/integration/`
