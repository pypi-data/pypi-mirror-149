Reviewer reports:
Reviewer 1: The manuscript titled "Wellmap: A file format for 96-well plates" 
describes a better approach to analyzing microplate data. In my opinion, this 
new tool could be helpful for wet-lab researchers in analyzing data with ease 
due to its layout visualization feature.

As minor remarks,

1. although the text describes that Wellmap could accommodate any layout, the 
   tile says only "96-wells".

2. Author demands Wellmap is better comparing plater, plate_maps, etc. I think 
   it would be helpful for readers to appreciate Wellmap if a pros and cons 
   comparison with existing tools (plater, plate_maps, platetools, cellHTS, 
   Plateo, Bioplate) incorporated in the discussion.
