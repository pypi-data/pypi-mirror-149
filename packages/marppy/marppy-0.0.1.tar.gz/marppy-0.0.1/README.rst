Modifed Apex - Rotated Pole
===========================

This is a python implimentation of coordinate conversions to the Modified Apex - Rotated Pole (MARP) coordinate system.  MARP is based on the Apex coordinate system (Richmond, 1995), but performs a coordinate transformation to rotate the pole of the coordinate system to an arbitrary location.  This is adventagious for doing calculations at high latitudes because it removes some of the geometric complications.

This code is heavily based on apexpy.
