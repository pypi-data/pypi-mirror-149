    Args
        sample_rate: int
            Value in Hz. Typically, 16000.
        window_length: float
            Value in seconds. A larger value means more context information which can be helpful
            for the recognition by the model.
            Typically, as long as the sound event takes at a maximum.
        frame_length: float
            Value in seconds, smaller than window_length. Smaller Values can decrease the delay
            between receiving the sound and getting a prediction result for it.
            A too small value can result in bad performance or a ValueError.

        sample_rate (int)
            Audio sampling rate in Hz
        window_length (float)
            Time in seconds of the audio context used for prediction.
        frame_length (float)
            Minimum resolution of the time in the sliding window in seconds.
        chunk_size (int)
            Number of frames separating the given window.
        frame_size (int)
            Number of samples for the given frame.
        window_size (int)
            Number of samples for the given window.

            Number of channels of the audio input.
            Have to be equal the channel number of the input device.
            Typically, 1 for mono mic or 2 for a stereo device.
        use_input (bool)
            Specifies whether an input device is to be used or not.
        input_device (int)
            Index of the device using for input.
        use_output (bool)
            Specifies whether an output device is to be used or not.
        output_device (int)
            Index of the device using for output.
        storage_length (float)
            Time in seconds, which should be stored for later independent use.
            Use 0 for no storing data in memory, <0 for storing all data without upper limit.
            Use with caution, can raise an unexpected memory overflow error!
