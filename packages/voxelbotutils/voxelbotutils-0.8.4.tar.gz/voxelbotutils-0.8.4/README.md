* Logging using Python's `logging.Logger` classes.
* Webhook sends on different events.
* Bot stats posting via StatsD and DataDog.
* A help command that doesn't look like trash.
* Owner-only commands.
* Presence auto-updating based on Twitch streamers.
* Website utilities.
* And more...

# Basic Usage

* Update your auto-generated config file in `config/config.toml`.
