# Parkinson detector

An Ensemble of CNN Models for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection

Medical support tool for fast preliminary diagnosis can be used by any medical personnel.  Parkinson detector is written in Python and runs in a normal Windows and Linux environment. The user interface was implemented using the Qt library. 

Our application can work directly with Dicom files (.dcm) from a digital CRT machine or with any image files (jpg, png, etc.). We make a simple user interface with drag-and-drop support.

**Note:** prediction from the application cannot be used as a medical diagnosis.
## Application requirements: 

* Operational system: 
    * Windows 7 or later
    * Ubuntu 16.04 or later
    * Mac OS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (64-bit) (no GPU support)
* Python 3.6 or later
* Hard Drive: 4Gb of free space,
* Processor: Intel Core i3,
* Memory (RAM): 3Gb or above free.
* Internet connection: wideband connection for first use (for neural network model downloading)
* Admin privileges are not a requirement
