# Parkinson detector

An Ensemble of CNN Models for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection

Medical support tool for fast preliminary diagnosis can be used by any medical personnel.  Parkinson detector is written in Python and runs in a normal Windows and Linux environment. The user interface was implemented using the Qt library. 

Our application can work directly with Dicom files (.dcm) from a digital CRT machine or with any image files (jpg, png, etc.). We make a simple user interface with drag-and-drop support.

**Note:** prediction from the application cannot be used as a medical diagnosis.
