2020-04-19: qpageview 0.5.0

Initial release. The qpageview module was developed by me, Wilbert Berendsen,
as a replacement of the qpopplerview module inside Frescobaldi, the LilyPond
sheet music text editor. I decided that it would be best if qpageview became
its own project, to make it easier to use this package in other applications.
