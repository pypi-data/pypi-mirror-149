A simple text-to-speech client using azure TTS API(trial). :laughing:

**TL;DR**: This program uses trial auth token of Azure Cognitive Services to do speech synthesis for you.

You can try the Azure TTS API online: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install --upgrade aspeak
```

## Usage

```
usage: aspeak [-h] [-V | -L | [-t [TEXT] | -s [SSML]]] [-p PITCH] [-r RATE] [-S STYLE] [-f FILE] [-o OUTPUT_PATH] [-l LOCALE] [-v VOICE]

This program uses trial auth token of Azure Cognitive Services to do speech synthesis for you

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -L, --list-voices     list available voices, you can combine this argument with -v and -l
  -t [TEXT], --text [TEXT]
                        Text to speak. Left blank when reading from file/stdin
  -s [SSML], --ssml [SSML]
                        SSML to speak. Left blank when reading from file/stdin
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Text/SSML file to speak, default to `-`(stdin)
  -o OUTPUT_PATH, --output OUTPUT_PATH
                        Output wav file path
  -l LOCALE, --locale LOCALE
                        Locale to use, default to en-US
  -v VOICE, --voice VOICE
                        Voice to use

Options for --text:
  -p PITCH, --pitch PITCH
                        Set pitch, default to 0
  -r RATE, --rate RATE  Set speech rate, default to 0.04
  -S STYLE, --style STYLE
                        Set speech style, default to "general"
```

- If you don't specify `-o`, we will use your default speaker.
- If you don't specify `-t` or `-s`, we will assume `-t` is provided.
- You must specify voice if you want to use `-p` or `-r` option.

### Examples

#### Speak "Hello, world!" to default speaker.

```sh
$ aspeak -t "Hello, world!" -o output.wav
```

#### List all available voices.

```sh
$ aspeak -L
```

#### List all available voices for Chinese.

```sh
$ aspeak -L -l zh-CN
```

#### Get information about a voice.

```sh
$ aspeak -L -v en-US-SaraNeural
```

#### Save synthesized speech to a file.

#### Custom pitch, rate and style

```sh
$ aspeak -t "你好，世界！" -v zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural -p 1.5 -r 0.5 -S sad
```

## About This Application

- I found Azure TTS can synthesize nearly authentic human voice, which is very interesting :laughing:.
- I wrote this program to learn Azure Cognitive Services.
- And I use this program daily, because `espeak` and `festival` outputs terrible :fearful: audio.
    - But I respect :raised_hands: their maintainers' work, both are good open source software and they can be used
      off-line.
- I hope you like it :heart:.
