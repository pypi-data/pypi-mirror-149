__Tasks__

- Build Server: Sort Authentification issues.
- Logging: DISPLAY EVERYTHING (PSF SIZE, IMAGER SIZE, MASK STUFF, IT WILL STOP BUGS).
- GUI code is horrific, clean up, CHECK IF INUT IS SCALED OR PIXELS.
- Simulating lenses is slow because the iterate grid is used for all visualization. Make a "sub_size_1" grid property.

__Features__

- Mass visualization for large runs in single folder, which works for database runs.
- Automated check of deflection angles against integration during lens modeling.
- DM many subhalo sims.


__Image To Source Mapping__

Mapping image arrays (e.g. the data) to the source plane so we can compare how the source-plane appears.

- Do for simple rectangular grid, then add subgrid, interpolation.
- Make magnification equivalent.


__Clump API__

- Scripts describing what a clump is.
- Example scripts showing how every clump maker task relates to autofit model composition.
- Point Source Models via PointModel API.
- Gradually build examples of increasing complexity (e.g. using elliptical measurements, luminosity / scaling relations,
hierarchical models, prior passing).
- Rich: API for fitting model sub components one by one, built into clump API.
- Multiwavelength 0_0.

__Point Source__

- Point source visusliazation, RMS of point source.


__Documentation__

- Search chaining readthedocs.
- add https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04665 where applicable.
- FAQ My reconstruction is a demagnified solution.

__Refactor__

- Revert to SciPy quad, remove pyquad not installed.


__Bugs__

- Raise exception if mask not applied to imaging and it is passed to analysis.
- No positions analysis bug, need to remove copy or something.
- Point source raises exception if solver grid smaller than data in analysi class.
- Sanity checks on datastructures wherer possible (e.g. output grid index is 2).
- Sanity checks on things like mapper uitil, inversion util, where a user may input an incorrect array (e.g. an unasked
noise map) and not get an error as an index limit is never hit.
