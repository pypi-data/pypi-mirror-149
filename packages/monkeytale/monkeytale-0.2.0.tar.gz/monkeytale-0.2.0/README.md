# Monkeytale v0.2.0

Monkeytale is a markup language for composing, documenting, and visualizing a novel from flat files. It is built to meet my needs and, thus, opinionated to a fault.

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Semantic Release](https://pypi.org/project/python-semantic-release/) help track progress with Monkeytale.

As per Semantic Versioning: "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable."

Some documentation may be written when Monkeytale is mature and stable.
