A simple plugin that converts Obsidian style callouts and turns them into mkdocs supported Admonitions.

## Limitations
This plugin replaces every instance of `> ` with 4 spaces, regardless of whether or not a callout block was specified on the lines prior. ` > This does render correctly`, but it may not be ideal.

## Setup
Install the plugin using pip:

`pip install mkdocs-callouts`

Activate the plugin in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - admonition

plugins:
  - search
  - callouts
```

> **Note:** If you have no `plugins` entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also want to add the `search` plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no `plugins` entry set, but now you have to enable it explicitly.

## Usage
mkdocs-callouts converts the following:
```
> [!INFO] Title
> An information callout from Obsidian
> inspired by the syntax from the Microsoft Docs
```
and turns it into:
```
!!! info "Title"
    An admonition block for MkDocs.
    Allowing you to edit your notes
    with confidence using Obsidian.
```
