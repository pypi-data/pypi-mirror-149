# Style information
# =================
# General style format should conform to Google Python best practices
# (http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), with the exception of a
# maximum line length of 120 where possible. Docstrings should also conform with Google Style.
# (https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
# A pylintrc file is included is the root directory to assist with formatting.

# Future updates
# ===============
#TODO: Features compatibility for multiple outcomes
#TODO: PyTorch CPH outcomes
#TODO: PyTorch stats.permutation_feature_importance (-> Features)
#TODO: PyTorch stats.predict_from_layer (used for permutation_feature_importance)
#TODO: implement native TF/PyTorch normalizers to improve realtime normalization speed
#TODO: improve estimated_num_tiles when doing tile extraction & no ROI (or QC)
#TODO: for tfrecord parser, combine utf-8 and image decoding into single `decode` argument (rather than decode_images)
#TODO: consider pytorch to_numpy=False returns tensor objects
