# `pthelper` - PyTorch
A python package containing the basic boilerplate code for training and evaluation of PyTorch models. The main purpose of this package is to remove writing the same code for training/inference again and again for different projects. 

Apart from training and evaluation, it also contains other helper functions to perform logging stats in the console as well as Keras like model summaries using [torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) package.

## Install
```pip install pthelper```
