# Sungrow Monitor
A python 3 module to allow direct monitoring of sungrow inverters over LAN TCP modbus connections.

Based on a modified version of [thomasfa18 script](https://github.com/thomasfa18/solar-sungrow) please check out their work if you are interested in a solution to upload data to [pvoutput.org](pvoutput.org).

Based on a cut down version of [Meltaxa's solarIoT script](https://github.com/meltaxa/solariot) please check out their work if you are interested in a full on prememsis solution.

The modbus map was generated from the official sungrow modbus specification and contains many registers. These are present simply as a register index to make it easier for anyone else that is looking for the information.

## Getting started
```python
from SungrowModbusClient import Client, sungrow_register

c = Client(sungrow_register.regmap, "192.168.0.120", 502)

c.load_register()

for i in c.inverter:
    print(i, c.inverter[i])
```

  - This has been tested on a a sungrow SG5.0RT inverter
  - A list of "valid devices" is included at the top of the modbus map, this came from the sungrow modbus specification document directly. It may work with other devices, I do not know.
  - The script only performs reads of the input registers (function code 04), if you do not know anything about modbus I would highly dicourage you from making changes.
  - In short, you are welcome to use this, but if you do you are agreeing that if something bad happens then it was not my fault and you can't sue me.
