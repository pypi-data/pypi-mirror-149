# TBlock

TBlock is a free and open-source system-wide ad-blocker that is compatible with most filter list formats.

## Features

- Free and open-source software
- Does not cost any money
- Does not track your personal data
- Does not make you fingerprintable, unlike some ad-blocking browser extensions
- Blocks ads for your whole operating system
- Compatible with most filter list formats
- Has an online filter repository to help you find and subscribe to filter lists in an easier way
- Has a built-in filter converter
- Has a built-in daemon that regularly updates the filter lists and prevents your hosts file from being edited by another program

## Installation

TBlock provides various installation methods. These installation methods can be found on the [website](https://tblock.codeberg.page/install.html) and in the [documentation](https://tblock.codeberg.page/docs/installation.html).

Though the developers encourage you to install the package that is compatible with your operating system, you can still TBlock install safely and easily with `pipx` (that will only install it for the current user):

```sh
pipx install tblock
```

Building TBlock manually can also be an option, although you'll have to check manually for new updates. To learn more about how to build the software manually, see [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md) or consult the [documentation](https://tblock.codeberg.page/docs/installation-build-manually.html).

## After installation

If you don't do anything after installing TBlock, it won't be able to block ads. You need to initialize it and to sync the online sources of your choice, in order to have an efficient blocking. The developers consider subscribing to the `tblock-base` list a good start. Right after the installation, you need to run (with administration privileges):

```sh
tblock -Sy tblock-base
```

## Issues

If you encounter an issue while you are using TBlock, or if you want to suggest a new feature, you have multiple options (because we don't want to force our users to join Codeberg to contribute to the project):

- [Open an issue on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tblock/tblock/issues)
- [Contact us via Email](mailto:tw4nn@disroot.org)

- [Contact us on XMPP](xmpp:tblock@conference.movim.eu)
- [Contact us on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@tblock)

If however you found a vulnerability in TBlock's code, it is important that you don't share it publicly, because other people could exploit it. In that case, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
