# Contributing to TBlock

Contributions are welcome from anybody. If you have a feature to request or a bug to report, you can [open an issue](https://codeberg.org/tblock/tblock/issues/) or [start a pull request](https://codeberg.org/tblock/tblock/pulls).

If you are interested to join the TBlock team and to work with us, please [send us an Email](mailto:tw4nn@disroot.org?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20contribute%20to%20TBlock). It would be really nice to have a lot of people working on this project.
