Intsall
-------

!pip install git+https://github.com/csabiu/WOC.git

Running
-------

woc(map1,map2,radii, mask=mask)

map1 is the 2D array of pixel values
map2 should be same shape as map1
radii is the array of radius values used to select the contours from map1 eg [100,200,300] in pixel units

optional: mask is the array used to mask both maps (0=masked, 1=unmasked)
