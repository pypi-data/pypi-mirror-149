DisVoice is a python framework designed to compute features from speech files. Disvoice computes glottal, phonation, articulation, prosody, phonological, and features representation learnig strategies using autoencders. The features can be computed both from sustained vowels and continuous speech utterances with the aim to recognize praliguistic aspects from speech.

The features can be used in classifiers to recognize emotions, or communication capabilities of patients with different speech disorders including diseases with functional origin such as larinx cancer or nodules; craneo-facial based disorders such as hipernasality developed by cleft-lip and palate; or neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Hungtinton's diseases.

The features are also suitable to evaluate mood problems like depression based on speech patterns.

### Install

Praat should be installed first, and the executable file should be added as an environmental variable. 

For linux

```
apt-get install praat
pip install disvoice
```

or

```python setup.py install```

For Windows

Donwload the latest version of Praat from https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/download_win.html

and add the path file to the environment variables

Then

```
pip install disvoice
```

or

```python setup.py install```



Kaldi must be installed beforehand for Kaldi output
