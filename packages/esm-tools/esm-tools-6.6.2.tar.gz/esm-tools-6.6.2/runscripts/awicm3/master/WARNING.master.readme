Note: 
The master branch experiments yaml scripts follow the latest developments of FESOM2 and OpenIFS.
New commits may come in multiple times a day. These scripts are not tested in any way shape of form. 
Use these only if you wich to test-drive the latest master branch changes. Otherwise it is recommended
you stick to v3.0 for stable branch or frontiers for a somewhat tested and contiuouly in use branch.
