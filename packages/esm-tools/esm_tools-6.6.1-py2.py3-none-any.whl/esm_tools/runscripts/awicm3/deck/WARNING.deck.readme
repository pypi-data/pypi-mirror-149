Note:
This is the very first version of AWICM3 that ran with esm_tools. 
This version contains severe bugs in the model coupling / physics. 
Unless you are specifacally interesting in studying these bugs,
you should probably use a newer version like v3.0 or frontiers.

These scripts are no longer maintained.
