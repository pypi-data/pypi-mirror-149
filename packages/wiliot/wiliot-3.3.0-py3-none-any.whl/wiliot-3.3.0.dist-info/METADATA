## Public Library

### MAC Installation
#### Getting around SSL issue on Mac with Python 3.7 and later versions

Python version 3.7 on Mac OS has stopped using the OS's version of SSL and started using Python's implementation instead. As a result, the CA
certificates included in the OS are no longer usable. To avoid getting SSL related errors from the code when running under this setup you need
to execute Install Certificates.command Python script. Typically you will find it under
~~~~
/Applications/Python\ 3.7/Install\ Certificates.command
~~~~

#### Python 3 on Mac
The default Python version on mac is 2.x. Since Wiliot package requires Python 3.x you should download Python3 
(e.g.  Python3.7) and make python 3 your default.
There are many ways how to do it such as add python3 to your PATH (one possible solution https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-the-path-variable-in-mac) 

#### Git is not working after Mac update
