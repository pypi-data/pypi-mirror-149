# Directord

Directord is a powerful automation platform and protocol built to drive
infrastructure and applications across the physical, edge, IoT, and cloud
boundaries; [efficient, pseudo-real-time, at scale](https://directord.com/analysis.html),
made simple.

## Design Principles

The Directord design principles can be
[found here](https://directord.com#first-principles).

## Documentation

Additional documentation covering everything from application design, wire
diagrams, installation, usage, and more can all be
[found here](https://directord.com).

## Welcome Contributors

* Read documentation on how best to deploy and leverage directord.

* When ready, if you'd like to contribute to Directord pull-requests are very
  welcomed. Directord is an open platform built for operators. If you see
  something broken, please feel free to raise a bug and/or fix it.

* Information on running tests can be [found here](https://directord.com/testing).

## Quick Introduction

This quick cast shows how easy it is to install, bootstrap, and deploy a scale test environment.

## Hello World

Let's create a virtual env on your local machine to bootstrap the installation,
once installed you can move to the server node and call all your tasks from there

``` shell
$ python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ~/directord
$ ~/directord/bin/pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
$ ~/directord/bin/pip install directord
```

We need to create a catalog for bootstrapping. Let's assume we are installing directord in two machines:

* directord-1 192.168.1.100 : directord server, a client

* directord-2 192.168.1.101 : Only a client

For that we create a file

``` shell
$ vi ~/directord-catalog.yaml
```

with the contents

``` yaml
directord_server:
  targets:
  - host: 192.168.1.100
  port: 22
  username: fedora

directord_clients:
  args:
    port: 22
    username: fedora
  targets:
  - host: 192.168.1.100
  - host: 192.168.1.101
```

We can now call directord to bootstrap the installation. Bootstrapping uses ssh to connect to the machines but after that ssh is no longer used.
and you only need the ssh keys to connect your local machine to the machines you are installing into the server and client do not need shared keys between themselves.

To kickstart the bootstrapping you call  directord with the catalog file you created and a catalog with the jobs required to bootstrap them.

``` shell
$ ~/directord/bin/directord bootstrap \
                            --catalog ~/directord-catalog.yaml  \
                            --catalog ~/directord/share/directord/tools/directord-dev-bootstrap-zmq.yaml
```
Once that is ran you can now ssh to the server and issue all the commands from there

``` shell
$ ssh fedora@192.168.1.100
```

First to make sure all the nodes are connected

``` shell
$ sudo /opt/directord/bin/directord manage --list-nodes
```

Should show you

``` shell
ID             EXPIRY  VERSION    HOST_UPTIME     AGENT_UPTIME
-----------  --------  ---------  --------------  --------------
directord-1    132.2   0.9.0      1:38:53.240000  0:00:00.051849
directord-2    131.69  0.9.0      1:39:25.780000  0:00:00.099533
```

Then we create our first orchestration job lets add a file called

``` shell
$ vi helloworld.yaml
```

With the contents

``` yaml
- jobs:
  - ECHO: hello world
```

Then we call the orchestration to use it

``` shell
$ sudo /opt/directord/bin/directord orchestrate helloworld.yaml
```

Should return something like:

``` shell
Job received. Task ID: 9bcf31cb-7faf-4367-bf37-57c11b3f81dc
```

We use that task ID to probe how the job went or we can list all the jobs with"

``` shell
$ sudo /opt/directord/bin/directord manage --list-jobs
```

That returns something like:

``` shell
ID                                    PARENT_JOB_ID                           EXECUTION_TIME    SUCCESS    FAILED
------------------------------------  ------------------------------------  ----------------  ---------  --------
9bcf31cb-7faf-4367-bf37-57c11b3f81dc  9bcf31cb-7faf-4367-bf37-57c11b3f81dc              0.02          2         0
```

With the task id we can see how the job went:

``` shell
$ sudo /opt/directord/bin/directord manage --job-info 9bcf31cb-7faf-4367-bf37-57c11b3f81dc
```

And voila here is our first orchestrated hello world:

``` shell
KEY                   VALUE
--------------------  -------------------------------------------------------
ID                    9bcf31cb-7faf-4367-bf37-57c11b3f81dc
INFO                  test1 = hello world
                      test2 = hello world
STDOUT                test1 = hello world
                      test2 = hello world
...
```
