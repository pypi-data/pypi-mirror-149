# This orchestration will deploy ssh keys and ensure all targets have
# a complete set of public keys from all other targets.
#
# NOTE(cloudnull): This orchestration highlights the power or "QUERY"
#                  which has the ability to notify targets of an "ARG"
#                  and how that ability can be leveraged within a simple
#                  blueprint.
