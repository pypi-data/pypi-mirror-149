GeneDom is a python library for managing the domestication of genetic parts so that they will comply to a genetic assembly standard. It puts together a `sequence optimizer <https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/DnaChisel>`_, genetic standards data, and a reporting system, to automate the domestication of large batches in an easy and human-friendly way.
