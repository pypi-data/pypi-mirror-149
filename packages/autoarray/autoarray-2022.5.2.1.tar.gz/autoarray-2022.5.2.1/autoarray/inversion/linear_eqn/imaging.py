        """
        When constructing the simultaneous linear equations (via vectors and matrices) the quantities of each individual
        linear object (e.g. their `mapping_matrix`) are combined into single ndarrays via stacking. This does not track
        which quantities belong to which linear objects, therefore the linear equation's solutions (which are returned
        as ndarrays) do not contain information on which linear object(s) they correspond to.

        For example, consider if two `Mapper` objects with 50 and 100 source pixels are used in an `Inversion`.
        The `reconstruction` (which contains the solved for source pixels values) is an ndarray of shape [150], but
        the ndarray itself does not track which values belong to which `Mapper`.

        This function converts an ndarray of a `reconstruction` to a dictionary of ndarrays containing each linear
        object's reconstructed data values, where the keys are the instances of each mapper in the inversion.

        The w-tilde formalism bypasses the calculation of the `mapping_matrix` and it therefore cannot be used to map
        the reconstruction's values to the data frame. Instead, the unique data-to-pixelization mappings are used,
        including the 2D convolution operation after mapping is complete.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reconstruction
            The reconstruction (in the source frame) whose values are mapped to a dictionary of values for each
            individual mapper (in the data frame).
