# AiiDAlab Widgets

[AiiDAlab](https://materialscloud.org/aiidalab) applications typically involve some of following steps:

 * Prepare the input for a calculation (e.g. an atomic structure).
 * Select computational resources and submit a calculation to AiiDA.
 * Monitor a running calculation.
 * Find and analyze the results of a calculation.

The AiiDAlab widgets help with these common tasks.

## Documentation

Hosted on [aiidalab-widgets-base.readthedocs.io](https://aiidalab-widgets-base.readthedocs.io).

## For maintainers

To create a new release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update [--major|--minor|--patch] [--tag [alpha|beta|rc]]`.
This will:

  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.
  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release and publishes it on PyPI.

Additional notes:

  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.
  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.
    Use the `--tag` option to switch the release tag.
  - This packages follows semantic versioning.
