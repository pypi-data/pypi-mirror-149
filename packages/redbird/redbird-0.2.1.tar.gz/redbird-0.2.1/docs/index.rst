Red-Bird: Repository Patterns for Python
========================================

Repository pattern is a technique to abstract the data access from
the domain/business logic. In other words, it decouples the database 
access from the application code. The aim is that the code runs the 
same regardless if the data is stored to an SQL database, NoSQL 
database, file or even as an in-memory list.

Why Repository Pattern?
-----------------------

Typically, data access in an application looks like this:

.. image:: /imgs/typical_application.png
    :align: center

The data access is often directly embedded with the application code.
Moreover, the communication with the database may even be tangled with the 
business logic in the application meaning that the database queries also
contain business logic and is not only for simple data access.

For many projects this approach may not cause additional difficulities but 
there are several problems with this approach related to readability and 
maintainability:

- Understanding the application requires undrestanding how the underlying
  database works.
- Migrating the databases may become a challenge in the application code.
- Creating unit tests is difficult as the querying language is embedded
  with the application and replacing the output with hard-coded lists
  is burdensome.  
- Separating production from development environment may be tricky if the
  connections are hard-coded and embedded to the application code.
- The code may become hard to read if multiple databases are used with 
  different querying languages.

Repository pattern aims to separate the domain layer (application logic) from 
the database layer (data access) by unifying the syntax for creating, acquiring,
modifying and deleting data in the data stores. It transforms generic actions
to the language a specific database understands.

In practice, this is illustrated below:

.. image:: /imgs/repository_pattern.png
    :align: center

The repositories act as translators to transform generic actions (read, 
create, update, delete data) to language the specific database understands.
The repositories may be configured at the configuraitons of the application
and they may easily be swapped to different database servers operating on 
the same or different querying language or data types. The application code 
is identical regardless if the data is in an SQL database, MongoDB or in-memory
lists. 


This has several benefits:

- Unit testing is easy as the repositories could be swapped to in-memory lists
- Database migrations is trivial as it require no code changes
- Using different databases or types of databases adds no additional maintenance costs
- Creating separate environments operating on different connections is easy.

However, there are some downsides with repository pattern as well. Most notably,
some features in querying languages cannot be replicated in a way that works
with all others simply due to that these features are missing in them. Especially,
some optimizations are such that cannot be replicated. However, most applications 
don't require optimized or complex queries. Furthermore, applications that 
do need them may still implement repository pattern and use database specific
queries only in places where this is unavoidable.

Terminology
-----------

Unit of Work
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Red Bird, the term *repository* is used to describe a 
specific data store that is a collection of items of the
same type (ie. a list of cars) and *item* is used to describe a record or 
a document with some attributes (ie. a car with registration number 123-456-789).
An attribute consists of the name of the attribute (ie. car color) and its 
value for specific item (ie. color of the car with registration number 123-456-789 is red).


The definition of these terms between various
data stores are illustrated below:

============== ===================== ================ =================================
Repository     Repository definition Item definition  Attribute definition
============== ===================== ================ =================================
Python memory  list                  object           attribute (object) or item (dict)
SQL            table                 row              column
MongoDB        collection            document         field
REST (HTTP)    URL endpoint          JSON object      field
============== ===================== ================ =================================

Operations
^^^^^^^^^^

There are four generic operations implemented by almost every data store:
create, read, update and delete. These are often called CRUD. Read-only
data store may only have read operation and some simple data stores may 
only have read, create and delete (such as a CSV file). For basic CRUD 
actions, Red Bird uses tems more commonly used in Python language: 
add, get, update and delete, respectively. Red bird also adds one more 
operation that is implemented in some data stores and could be implemented
to others by combining existing operations: replace. Replace is an update
but it also removes attributes that were not changed.

These unified methods for manipulating data (a single item) are illustrated below:

============== ================ =========== =========== ================ =======================
Repository     get              add         delete      update           replace
============== ================ =========== =========== ================ =======================
Python memory  list.__getitem__ list.append list.pop    setattr          repo.delete & repo.add
SQL            SELECT           INSERT      DELETE      UPDATE           repo.delete & repo.add
MongoDB        findOne          insertOne   deleteOne   updateOne        repo.delete & repo.add
REST (HTTP)    GET              POST        DELETE      PATCH            PUT
============== ================ =========== =========== ================ =======================

In addition, operations can also be divided to those that affect only one item and 
to those that affect multiple items. If you search for a car with registration 
number 123-456-789 you should should only get one car or none whereas if you 
search for cars with a red color you may get multiple, one or none. The same applies
for other operations as well.

Example
-------

First we create a simple in-memory repository that has ``registration_number`` as the attribute
that is unique for each item:

.. code-block::

  from redbird.repos import MemoryRepo
  repo = MemoryRepo(id_field="registration_number")

Create operation:

.. code-block::

  repo.add({"registration_number": "123-456-789", "color": "red"})
  repo.add({"registration_number": "111-222-333", "color": "red"})
  repo.add({"registration_number": "444-555-666", "color": "blue"})

Get operation:

.. code-block::

  # One item
  repo["123-456-789"]

  # Multiple items
  repo.filter_by(color="red").all()

Update operation:

.. code-block::

  # One item
  repo["123-456-789"] = {"condition": "good"}

  # Multiple items
  repo.filter_by(color="blue").update(color="green")

Delete operation:

.. code-block::

  # One item
  del repo["123-456-789"]

  # Multiple items
  repo.filter_by(color="red").delete()
