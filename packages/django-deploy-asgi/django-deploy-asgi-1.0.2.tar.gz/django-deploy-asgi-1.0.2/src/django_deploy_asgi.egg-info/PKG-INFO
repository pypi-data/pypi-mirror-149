# WHY ROOT?
We need sudo permissions in order to create a service in /etc/systemd/system so you can create a consistent service that you manually later will enable for persistency
We create files only in the nexts directories using md5 hashes of the DEPLOY_NAME set by the user in settings.py:
* /etc/systemd/system/*_django_asgi.service|socket
* /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*_django_asgi
