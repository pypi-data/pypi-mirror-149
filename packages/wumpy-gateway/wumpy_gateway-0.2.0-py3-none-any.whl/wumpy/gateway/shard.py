class Shard:
    """Simple implementation of the Discord gateway.

    To get started, instantiate a Shard instance and use it as an asynchronous
    context manager:

    ```python
    async with Shard('wss://gateway.discord.gg/', 'ABC.XYZ', 1) as conn:
        ...
    ```

    This way, the shard will ensure the connection is successfully closed once
    you're done. The shard also uses this opportunity to launch a task that
    indefinitely sends heartbeat commands and keeps the connection alive.

    The next part is to start receiving events - all you need to do is iterate
    through it as an asynchronous iterator:

    ```python
    async with Shard('wss://gateway.discord.gg/', 'ABC.XYZ', 1) as conn:
        async for event in conn:
            ...
    ```

    This is an endless loop that should never terminate because
    reconnecting and keeping the connection alive is all handled. `event` is
    the deserialized JSON that Discord sent over the gateway.

    Examples:

        ```python
        import asyncio

        from wumpy.gateway import Shard

        async def handle_event(payload):
            print(f"Received {payload['t']}:", payload['d'])

        async def main():
            # Replace the ... with the uri, token and intents to use
            async with Shard(...) as ws:
                async for event in ws:
                    await handle_event(event)

        asyncio.run(main)
