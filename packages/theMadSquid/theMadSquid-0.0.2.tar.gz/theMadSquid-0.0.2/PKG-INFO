Description: # About PyPlanet Studio is a python module/library that can be used to make calculations for planets. This tool is primarily for worldbuilders who do not want to do the math on their own and want a program to do it for them. --- In PyPlanet Studio there are two kinds of things that you can do. There are functions, which will do calculations for you and return the answer. There are also components. In PyPlanet Studio components are just preset python classes. They can be used to get more information about your planet once the component is created by using things such as: ```myGravity.gravity``` or ```myEscape.unit```. --- The full PyPlanet Studio documentation can be found at tinyurl.com/pyplanetstudiodocs, giving information about how to use functions and components and what each one does. Hope you enjoy using this python module/library, and hope you create something that you like.
