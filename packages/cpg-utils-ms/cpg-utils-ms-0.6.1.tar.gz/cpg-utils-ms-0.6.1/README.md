# cpg-utils-ms

This is a Python library containing convenience functions that are specific to the CPG.

In order to install the library, run:

```bash
pip install cpg-utils-ms
```

To use the library, import functions like this:

```python
from cpg_utils.config import get_deploy_config
```

We use `bumpversion` for incrementing the library's semantic version. A new PyPi package gets published automatically whenever a version bump commit is merged with the `main` branch.
