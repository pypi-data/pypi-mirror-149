        # Logger builder
        Package meant to be a facade for native logging. It simplifies the creation of the logger and
        using several handlers.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        Python > 3.6
        
        ## Installation
        The Package is available directly on the Python Package Index
        ```
        pip install logger_builder
        
        ```
        
        ## Running
        The use of the basic stream logger involves initialization of the formatter, stream handler factory,
        logger builder, and running the create logger function.
        ```
        from logger_builder import LoggerBuilder
        from logger_builder.formatter import create_formatter
        from logger_builder.handler.factory import StreamHandlerFactory
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            formatter = create_formatter(simple_description=True)
        
            stream_handler_factory = StreamHandlerFactory(formatter)
        
            handler_factories = [stream_handler_factory]
            logger_builder = LoggerBuilder(handler_factories)
            logger = logger_builder.create_logger("example")
        
            logger.info(f"Log something")
        
        ```
        
        Log to file , and buffering handler factories were implemented as well (FileHandlerFactory, and
        MemoryHandlerFactory, respectively).
