Please read 'Bayesian ROC Tookit Documentation.docx' for details.  
  
BayesianROC is a subclass of DeepROC (from the Deep ROC Toolkit).  It computes measures related to the Chance and Bayesian iso performance baselines and produces associated plots.  
  
TestChanceROC.py, creates a BayesianROC object and performs tests for the Binary Chance paper. When TestChanceROC.py is run: for all the interactive input questions, just hit enter to accept the defaults and only change the costs to what you want.
