This package contains OpenAI Gym environment designed for training RL agents to control the flight of a two-dimensional drone. The environment is automatically registered under id: drone-2d-custom-v0, so it can be easily used by RL agent training libraries, such as StableBaselines3.<br /><br />At the https://github.com/marek-robak/Drone-2d-custom-gym-env-for-reinforcement-learning.git you can find a detailed description of the environment, along with a description of the package installation and sample code made to train and evaluate agents in this environment.<br /><br />This environment was created for the needs of my bachelor's thesis, available at https://www.ap.uj.edu.pl/diplomas/151837/ site.
