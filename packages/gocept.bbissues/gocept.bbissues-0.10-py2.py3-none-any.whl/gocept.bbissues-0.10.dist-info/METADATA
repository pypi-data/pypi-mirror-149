You have to provide a config file with the following content::

    [config]
    log = issues.log
    html_export_path = export.html
    json_export_path = export.json
    # The next line is optional it defaults to index.jj2 in the package
    template_path = template.jj2


    [bitbucket]
    # The owner always has to be provided. All projects by this owner
    # will be collected.
    owner = owner
    # Specific projects may be provided in the following way
    projects = owner:project1
               owner:project2

    [github]
    # The owner always has to be provided. All projects by this owner
    # will be collected.
    owner = owner
    # Specific projects may be provided in the following way
    projects = owner:project1
               owner:project2

             {{issue.content}}
             {{issue.status}}
             {{issue.created}}
             {{issue.priority}}
             {{issue.url}}
