To-do
-----

A list of things we should fix/implement before the first major release.

- [ ] Figure out PDF upload mechanism for forks (@adrn's solution). Should we add "pr" to the workflow triggers in the cookiecutter template?
- [ ] Fix docs
- [ ] Regarding Zenodo deposits with tarballs containing lots of files: consider supporting directories (instead of specific files) in the ``contents`` mapping of the config file.
- [ ] Test uploads of very large files
