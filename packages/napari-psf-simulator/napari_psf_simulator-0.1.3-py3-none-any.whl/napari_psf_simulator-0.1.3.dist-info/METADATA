A plugin for the simulation of the 3D Point Spread Function of an optical systen, particularly a microscope objective.
 
Calculates the PSF as the squared Fourier Transform of the pupil and uses the angular spectrum to propagate the PSF in 3D.  
The following aberrations are included:
- phase aberration described by a Zernike polynomials with n-m coefficients
- aberration induced by a slab, with a refractive index different from the one at the object (only scalar approximation is used, polarization not considered yet).  

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.
