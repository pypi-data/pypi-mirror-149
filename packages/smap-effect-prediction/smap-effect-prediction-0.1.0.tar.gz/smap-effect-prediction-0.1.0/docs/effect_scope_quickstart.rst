Scope & Quick Start

Scope
-----

The module **SMAP effect prediction** is designed to provide biological interpretation of the haplotype call tables created by **SMAP haplotype-window**.  

It's main functions are to:

	  1. Filter for haplotypes with edits in a defined region of interest (ROI; *e.g.* surrounding the PAM site for CRISPR-Cas experiments) to eliminate noise from the genotype table.  
	  #. Substitute the segment of the original reference gene sequence by the observed haplotype, keeping track of all relevant coordinates of intron-exon borders, translational start and stop codons, and the open reading frame (ORF), and predict the resulting (mutated) protein sequence.  
	  #. Compare the novel predicted protein sequence to the original reference protein and estimate the fraction of the protein length that is still encoded by the novel (mutated) allele.  
	  #. Use a threshold for the %protein length required for (partial) loss of function, and classify all haplotypes by effect class (no/minimal effect, intermediate effect, loss-of-function).  
	  #. Aggregate all observed haplotypes and sum their relative frequencies per effect class.  
	  #. Finally, discretize the genotype calls as homozygous or heterozygous for reference versus loss of function at a user defined minimal effect level.  
	  #. Plot summary statistics of editing "fingerprints" across the data set to allow the user to optimize parameter setting accoring to their experimental data.

Integration in the SMAP package
-------------------------------

.. image:: images/SMAP_global_overview_sites_window_design_effect_WGS_transparent.png

Within the SMAP package, the modules **SMAP target-selection**, **SMAP design**, **SMAP haplotype-window** and **SMAP effect-prediction** are designed to provide a seamless workflow from target selection (e.g. candidate genes), integrated primer and gRNA design, 

multiplex resequencing of target loci across large plant collections, followed by identification of all observed haplotypes (naturally occuring or CRISPR-induced sequence variants), the prediction of functional effects of sequence variants at the protein level to identify (partial) loss-of-function (LOF) alleles, 
and finally aggregate and discretize genotype calls in an integrated genotype table with the homozygous/heterozygous presence of LOF alleles per locus per sample.
The overarching goal of this entire workflow is to identify carriers of LOF alleles for functional analysis, or for genotype-phenotype associations.
Specific functionalities of the other modules are given in their online manuals.

Specifically, the underlying concepts of **SMAP effect-prediction** exploit:

	1.  Modularity, compatibility throughout the entire workflow.  
	#.  Flexibility in design (scalability to complex multi-amplicon / multi-gRNA design per gene).  
	#.  Predicted effect of the observed mutation on the encoded protein level.  
	#.  Customized aggregation of effects per haplotype (thresholds).  
	#.  Customized aggregation of alleles per effect class per locus (thresholds).  
	#.  Discretizing the complex haplotype table to a simple homozygous / heterozygous LOF effect per locus per sample.  
	#.  Single command line operation per module.  
	#.  Traceable output (discrete LOF-call genotype table, alignments, VCF-encoded variants, predicted proteins).  
	#.  Biology-driven decisions.

Guidelines for **SMAP effect-prediction**
-----------------------------------------

These tabs provide a decision scheme to guide you to the correct parameter settings.  

.. tabs::

	.. tab:: Overview
	  
		| Answer the :navy:`questions in blue` according to your data and analysis objectives. See section Recommendations and guidelines for further details.  

	.. tab:: Start the decision scheme

		| You have: 
		| ðŸ‘‰ a FASTA file with reference sequences.  
		| ðŸ‘‰ A GFF file with border positions in the reference sequence to delineate amplicon positions.  
		| ðŸ‘‰ A master table with relative haplotype frequencies per sample from **SMAP haplotype-window**.  
		|  
		| :navy:`Do you want to filter for mutations in regions of interest (ROI) within haplotype sequences (e.g. based on gRNA position)?`  

		.. tabs::

			.. tab:: YES, use ROI
			
				| Yes, I want to consider mutations only in a specific range around the gRNA cut site.  

				| I must therefore:  
				| ðŸ‘‰ provide a GFF file with the coordinates of the gRNAs ``option -u``.  
				| ðŸ‘‰ define the lower bounds ``option -r`` and upper bounds ``option -s`` around the cutsite, as nucleotide distance.  
				| and  
				|    ðŸ‘‰ define an offset for the cut site position ``option -f`` relative to the gRNA 5â€™ end  
				|    or  
				|    ðŸ‘‰ use a predefined offset by selecting a CAS protein ``option -p``.  
				
				| This will define the region of interest (ROI) searched for mutations. Any mutation that overlaps with at least one nucleotide to the ROI is retained. Mutations outside the ROI are considered as reference sequence and ignored for the prediction of the protein sequence (only the sequences corresponding to the ROI are substituted to the reference sequence before ORF translation). Haplotypes with only mutations outside the ROI are collapsed with the reference haplotype during aggregation.
				| Check out the schemes below for the definition of lower ``-r`` and upper bounds ``-s``, offset ``-f or -p``, and ROI for gRNAs located on the forward and/or reverse strand ``-u``.

						| Yes, I want to predict the encoded protein by substitution of the haplotype sequence in the corresponding reference sequence, and translation of the resulting ORF.  
						|  
						| I must therefore:

								| I must therefore:

										| Yes, I want to discretize the aggregated frequencies into categorical groups (*i.e.* genotype calls).  
										|

										| ðŸ‘‰ set discrete calls ``option -e`` to get binary presence/absence data.
