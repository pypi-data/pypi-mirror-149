pydepict
========

A library and accompanying program for parsing SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) strings and generating 2D depictions of chemical structures from these strings.

It was originally developed as part of a 3rd year computer science dissertation project.

Prerequisites
-------------

pydepict requires **Python 3.7 or newer**, and uses the following packages:

- pygame
- NetworkX

Specific versions of these libraries can be found in ``requirements.txt``.
