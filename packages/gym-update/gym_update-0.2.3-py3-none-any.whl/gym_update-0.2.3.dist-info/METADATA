# Gym-style API environment


#### The domain features a continuos state and action space:
Action space: self.action_space = spaces.Box(
                                      low = np.float32(-np.array([2, 2, 2])),
                                      high = np.float32(np.array([2, 2, 2])))
*the actions represent the coefficients thetas of a logistic regression that will be run on the dataset of patients            

Observation space: self.observation_space = spaces.Box(
                                                low=np.array([0], 
                                                high=np.array([1], 
                                                dtype=np.float32)            
*the states represent values for the covariates X_a, X_s

#### The environment resets:

New population of patients at every episode
This is represented by a cross-sectional dataset with variables X_a, X_s, Y and N observations (# patients);
X_a, X_s follows a truncated normal distribution (a=0, b=inf)
Y follows a Binomial distribution Bin(p, n), p=0.5

#### The agent takes a step in the environment:

He sees all patients and take an action a={theta_0, theta_1, theta_2}
He runs a logistic regression on the patients using the action taken
He computes the logit risk of each observation (\rho_1)
He computes the g value, using \rho_1 and X_a
He replaces the initial X_a with the g value, for each observation

He runs a logistic regression on the patients as a covariate has changed in value, retrieve new theta parameters (thetas2)
He computes the logit risk of each observation (\rho_2)
He computes the mean logit risk, which is the reward given by the environment back to the agent (as a result of the 'good deed' of the action)

The reward represents the mean hospitalization rate of the 'intervened' population of patients
Then the episode ends and the environment resets
