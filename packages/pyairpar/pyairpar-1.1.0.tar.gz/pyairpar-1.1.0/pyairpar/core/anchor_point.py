        ### Description:

        The `AnchorPoint` in `pyairpar` is the way to split a Bézier curve within an `pyairpar.core.airfoil.Airfoil`
        into two Bézier curves and satisfy \\(G^0\\), \\(G^1\\), and \\(G^2\\) continuity at the joint between the
        curves. Examples of implemented `AnchorPoint`s in an unnecessarily strange airfoil shape are shown in the
        image below. It may be helpful to enlarge the image by opening it in a new tab.

        ### Args:

        `x`: ( \\(x\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` describing the x-location of the `AnchorPoint`

        `y`: ( \\(y\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` describing the y-location of the `AnchorPoint`

        `previous_anchor_point`: a `str` representing the previous `AnchorPoint` (counter-clockwise ordering)

        `L`: ( \\(L\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` describing the distance between the control points on either
        side of the `pyairpar.core.anchor_point.AnchorPoint`

        `R`: ( \\(R\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` representing the radius of curvature at the \\(x\\) - \\(y\\)
        location of the `AnchorPoint`. A positive value makes the airfoil convex at the `AnchorPoint` location,
        and a negative value makes the airfoil concave at the `AnchorPoint` location. A value of 0 creates a
        flat-plate-type leading edge. The valid range is \\( R \\in [-\infty, \infty] \\). Inclusive brackets are
        used here because setting \\(R=\\pm \\infty\\) creates an anchor point with no curvature (infinite radius of
        curvature).

        `r`: ( \\(r\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` representing the ratio of the distance from the `AnchorPoint`
        location to the neighboring control point closest to the trailing edge to the distance between the
        `AnchorPoint`'s neighboring control points ( \\(L_{fore} / L\\) ). The valid range is \\(r \\in (0,1)\\).

        `phi`: ( \\(\\phi\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` representing the angle of the line passing through the
        `AnchorPoint`'s neighboring control points, referenced counter-clockwise from the chordline if the
        `AnchorPoint` is on the upper airfoil surface and clockwise from the chordline if the `AnchorPoint` is on the
        lower airfoil surface. The valid range is \\(\\psi_1 \\in [-180^{\\circ},180^{\\circ}]\\). A value of \\(0^{
        \\circ}\\) creates an anchor point with local slope equal to the slope of the chordline.

        `psi1`: ( \\(\\psi_1\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` representing the angle of the aft curvature control "arm."
        Regardless of the sign of \\(R\\) or which surface the `AnchorPoint` lies on, an angle of \\(90^{\\circ}\\)
        always means that the curvature control arm points perpendicular to the line passing through the
        neighboring control points of the `AnchorPoint`. Angles below \\(90^{\\circ}\\) "tuck" the arms in, and angles
        above \\(90^{\\circ}\\) "spread" the arms out. The valid range is \\(\\psi_1 \\in [0^{\\circ},180^{\\circ}]\\).

        `psi2`: ( \\(\\psi_2\\) ) `pyairpar.core.param.Param` representing the angle of the fore curvature control
        "arm." Regardless of the sign of \\(R\\) or which surface the `AnchorPoint` lies on, an angle of \\(90^{
        \\circ}\\) always means that the curvature control arm points perpendicular to the line passing through the
        neighboring control points of the `AnchorPoint`. Angles below \\(90^{\\circ}\\) "tuck" the arms in,
        and angles above \\(90^{\\circ}\\) "spread" the arms out. The valid range is \\(\\psi_2 \\in [0^{\\circ},
        180^{\\circ}]\\).

        `length_scale_dimension`: a `float` giving the length scale by which to non-dimensionalize the `x` and `y`
        values (optional)
