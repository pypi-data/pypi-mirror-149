Description: # Distributions
        This package calculates Gaussian and binomial distributions and is part of an exercise of Udacity's nano degree program in data science. 
        
        ## Installation
        You can use pip to install the package:
        '''python
        pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ distributions-for-dsnd
        '''
        
        ## Usage
        '''python
        from distributions_for_dsnd import Gaussian, Binomial
        
        # returns a Gaussian distribution with a mean and standard deviation equal to the input
        Gaussian(10, 7)
        
        # returns a Binomial distribution with a probability and number of samples equal to the input
        Binomial(0.4, 25)
