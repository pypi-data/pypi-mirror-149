Yet another [PEP 517][1] backend.

This is the backend for [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev) projects, while you can also use it alone.
It reads the metadata of [PEP 621][2] format and coverts it to [Core metadata][3].

## Use as PEP 517 build backend

Edit your `pyproject.toml` as follows:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["pdm-pep517"]
build-backend = "pdm.pep517.api"
```

## Tool specific settings

Besides of the standard fields specified in PEP 621, PDM-PEP517 honors some other settings to change the build behavior. They should be defined under `[tool.pdm]` table:

```toml
[tool.pdm]
# Specify where the Python packages live.
package-dir = "src"
# File patterns to include, the paths are relative to the project root.
includes = []
# File patterns to exclude, the paths are relative to the project root.
excludes = []
# File patterns to include in source distribution and exclude in wheel distribution.
source-includes = []
# An extra script to populate the arguments of `setup()`, one can build C extensions with this script.
build = "build.py"
# Override the Is-Purelib value in the wheel.
is-purelib = true
# Change the editable-backend: path(default) or editables
editable-backend = "editables"
```

You don't have to specify all of them, PDM-PEP517 can also derive these fields smartly, based on some best practices of Python packaging.

## Supported config settings

`pdm-pep517` allows passing `config_settings` to modify the build behavior. It use the same option convention as `python setup.py bdist_wheel`.

```
--python-tag
    Override the python implementation compatibility tag(e.g. cp37, py3, pp3)
--py-limited-api
    Python tag (cp32|cp33|cpNN) for abi3 wheel tag
--plat-name
    Override the platform name(e.g. win_amd64, manylinux2010_x86_64)
```

For example, you can supply these options with [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/):

```bash
python -m build --sdist --wheel --outdir dist/ --config-setting="--python-tag=cp37" --config-setting="--plat-name=win_amd64"
```

`pip` doesn't support passing `config_settings` yet, please stick to `build` as the recommended frontend.
