# OneLineriser
One-line your code easily but still with the fun of doing so!

Have YOU ever wanted to write one-line Python code, but don't have the sanity to do it?
Do YOU want to write one-line code YOURSELF and not be a script kiddie or do ctrl-c ctrl-v?

Well not to worry, because I am here to remove your braincells for you!
Introducing... :tada:

The **OneLineriser**
<sub><sup>heh say that ten times real quick</sup></sub>

## How to use

### Installation
You can install this as a package by running
```
pip install onelinerise
```
Alternatively, install the master branch at
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Jus-Codin/OneLinerise
```

### Usage
```py
from onelineriser import OneLinerise
OneLinerise(globals()).print("test").literal(10).returned.bit_length().RET_OBJ.save_last_as("bruh").print_last.print(bruh)

# Output
>>> test
>>> 4
>>> 4
```

### Why should you use this
Well... you really shouldn't. Truth be told I just randomly came up with this idea and made it, and it really isn't the best implementation.
There definitely is a better way to do this, but I currently probably don't have the skills to do it
#### More reasons not to use
- No type hinting yet
- Inefficient code
- Not fully implemented
- Bruh it's unreadable man don't even try putting this in your projects

### Sidenote
I will try to come back to this, in fact I have a few ideas in mind:
 - [ ] Implement If-loops, For-loops, While-loops and such
 - [ ] Better documentation
 - [ ] Improved implementation
 - [ ] Customisable settings? Maybe?
 - [ ] And maybe even more

If you do have suggestions or want to contribute, do feel free to open an issue or pull request. As this repo is informal, I'm not putting guidelines and stuff for this project, all just default barebones settings
