# ## 2 - Overview of the Problem set ##
#
# **Problem Statement**: a dataset ("data.h5") containing:
#     - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
#     - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
#     - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).
#
# Goal: build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.

# Loading the data (cat/non-cat)
train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()

# We added "_orig" at the end of image datasets (train and test) because we are going to preprocess them. After preprocessing, we will end up with train_set_x and test_set_x (the labels train_set_y and test_set_y don't need any preprocessing).
#
# Each line of your train_set_x_orig and test_set_x_orig is an array representing an image. You can visualize an example by running the following code. Feel free also to change the `index` value and re-run to see other images. 

# Example of a picture
index = 2
plt.imshow(train_set_x_orig[index])
print(
    "y = "
    + str(train_set_y[:, index])
    + ", it's a '"
    + classes[np.squeeze(train_set_y[:, index])].decode("utf-8")
    + "' picture."
)

# Find the values for:

# Remember that `train_set_x_orig` is a numpy-array of shape (m_train, num_px, num_px, 3). For instance, you can access `m_train` by writing `train_set_x_orig.shape[0]`.

# For convenience, you should now reshape images of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) in a numpy-array of shape (num_px $*$ num_px $*$ 3, 1). After this, our training (and test) dataset is a numpy-array where each column represents a flattened image. There should be m_train (respectively m_test) columns.
#
# Reshape the training and test data sets so that images of size (num_px, num_px, 3) are flattened into single vectors of shape (num\_px $*$ num\_px $*$ 3, 1).
#
# A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b$*$c$*$d, a) is to use: 
# ```python
# X_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape[0], -1).T      # X.T is the transpose of X
# ```

# Reshape the training and test examples
train_set_x_flatten = train_set_x_orig.reshape(train_set_x_orig.shape[0], -1).T

# To represent color images, the red, green and blue channels (RGB) must be specified for each pixel, and so the pixel value is actually a vector of three numbers ranging from 0 to 255.
#
# One common preprocessing step in machine learning is to center and standardize your dataset, meaning that you substract the mean of the whole numpy array from each example, and then divide each example by the standard deviation of the whole numpy array. But for picture datasets, it is simpler and more convenient and works almost as well to just divide every row of the dataset by 255 (the maximum value of a pixel channel).
#
# <!-- During the training of your model, you're going to multiply weights and add biases to some initial inputs in order to observe neuron activations. Then you backpropogate with the gradients to train the model. But, it is extremely important for each feature to have a similar range such that our gradients don't explode. You will see that more in detail later in the lectures. !--> 
#
# Let's standardize our dataset.

#
# Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
# - Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
# - Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1)
# - "Standardize" the data

# ## 3 - General Architecture of the learning algorithm ##
#
# It's time to design a simple algorithm to distinguish cat images from non-cat images.
#
# You will build a Logistic Regression, using a Neural Network mindset. The following Figure explains why **Logistic Regression is actually a very simple Neural Network!**
#
#
# **Mathematical expression of the algorithm**:
#
# For one example $x^{(i)}$:
# $$z^{(i)} = w^T x^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
# $$\hat{y}^{(i)} = a^{(i)} = sigmoid(z^{(i)})\tag{2}$$ 
# $$ \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) =  - y^{(i)}  \log(a^{(i)}) - (1-y^{(i)} )  \log(1-a^{(i)})\tag{3}$$
#
# The cost is then computed by summing over all training examples:
# $$ J = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\tag{6}$$

model = LogitModel()

    train_set_x, train_set_y, num_iterations=2000, learning_rate=0.005, print_cost=True

# Plot learning curve (with costs)

# ## 4 - Further analysis
#
# Let's analyze it further, and examine possible choices for the learning rate $\alpha$. 

# #### Choice of learning rate ####
#
# **Reminder**:
# In order for Gradient Descent to work you must choose the learning rate wisely. The learning rate $\alpha$  determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may "overshoot" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.
#
# Let's compare the learning curve of our model with several choices of learning rates. Run the cell below. This should take about 1 minute. Feel free also to try different values than the three we have initialized the `learning_rates` variable to contain, and see what happens.
