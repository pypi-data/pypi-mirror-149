# Python Project Creator

This project generates Python code to start a new project.

In the current state it supports well the following templates:

- [x] **basic**: A basic project with a main.py file
- [x] **cp**: Contains the files used to solve competitive programming problems.

Still need some testing:

- [ ] **pip**: A template to create a package that will be uploaded to PIP.

In the future, I expect to create templates that need more sophisticated code generation, such as:

- [ ] **flask**: A template to be used when starting a Flask project.
