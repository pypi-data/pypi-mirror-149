# See for yourself!
The example below is an algorithm to trade Twitter stocks using the moving average crossover strategy.
```python
from harvest.algo import *
from harvest.trader import *

class Watch(BaseAlgo):
    def config(self):
        self.watchlist = ["TWTR"]
        self.interval = "5MIN"

    def main(self):
        sma_long = self.sma(period=50)
        sma_short = self.sma(period=20)
        if self.crossover(sma_long, sma_short):
            self.buy()
        elif self.crossover(sma_short, sma_long):
            self.sell()
```
To paper trade using this algorithm, run the following command:
```bash
harvest start -s yahoo -b paper 
```
To live trade using Robinhood, run:
```bash
harvest start -s robinhood -b robinhood
```
With Harvest, the process of testing and deploying your strategies is a piece of cake üç∞
