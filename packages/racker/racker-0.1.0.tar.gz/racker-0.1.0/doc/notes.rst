CHANGES WITH 250:

    * The GPT image dissection logic in systemd-nspawn/systemd-dissect/â€¦
      now is able to decode images for non-native architectures as well.
      This allows systemd-nspawn to boot images of non-native architectures
      if the corresponding user mode emulator is installed and
      systemd-binfmtd is running.
