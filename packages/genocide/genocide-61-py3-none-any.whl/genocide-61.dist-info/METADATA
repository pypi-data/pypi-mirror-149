**NAME**

|

**GENOCIDE** - Prosecutor. Reconsider. OTP-CR-117/19. 

| 

**SYNOPSIS**

::

    sudo genocidectl <cmd> [key=value] [key==value]


**DESCRIPTION**


**GENOCIDE** is a python3 program that holds evidence that the king of the
netherlands is doing a genocide, a written response where the king of
the netherlands confirmed taking note of “what i have written”, namely
proof that medicine he uses in treatement laws like zyprexa, haldol,
abilify and clozapine are poison that makes impotent, is both physical
(contracted muscles) and mental (let people hallucinate) torture and kills
members of the victim groups.

**GENOCIDE** contains correspondence with the International Criminal Court, 
asking for arrest of the king of the netherlands, for the genocide he is
committing with his new treatement laws. Current status is an outside the
jurisdiction judgement of the prosecutor which requires a reconsider to have
the king actually arrested.

**GENOCIDE** is also a solid, non hackable bot, that runs under systemd as a 
24/7 background service and starts after reboot, intended to be programmable
in a static, only code, no popen, no imports and no reading modules from a
directory. It can show genocide and suicide stats into the channel, display rss
feeds and log simple text messages.

**GENOCIDE** installs 52 files containing photo's and pdf's of communications
between me, the first chamber, king and prosecutor. If you do not wish to have
them installed a simple ``pip3 uninstall genocide`` will remove them from the
system.  


**INSTALL**

::

  $ sudo pip3 install genocide


**CONFIGURATION**


configuration is done by calling the ``cfg`` command of the ``genocidectl``
program.

**sasl**

  $ sudo genocidectl pwd <nickservnick> <nickservpass>
  $ sudo genocidectl cfg password=<outputfrompwd>

**users**
