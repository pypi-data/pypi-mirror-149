## CONFIGURATION [if pulled repostory from GitHub]

*QUICKNOTE:* Some of this configuration may be outdated or not stable depending on your os.

You don't need to bother with those configurations if you pull this as a package from PyPI.


### Install the packages

To install the required packages, simply run in the terminal:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### IRODS environment

To connect to CyVerse, you need your profile to be set.To retrieve this profile, the irods client tries:
    1. Using the configuration file located in ~/.irods/irods_environment.json
    2. If not located, the file given by the environment variable IRODS_ENVIRONMENT_FILE

WARNING: If your access to CyVerse through IRODS already works locally, there would be no need to do this step.

Once this has been done one time, there will be no need for using this method on local machines.

If you are working within Docker containers or VMs environment, you may need to call this at the beginning of each task.


### Cache folders

To configure the cache, open the file ```/global_variables/global_variables.py```.

Then set the variable ```local_path``` to the root of the folder you will be working into.
Check out the file ```example_irods``` for an example of such configuration.
