# Sage - Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications

This package was designed as part of a Project at Southern Utah University.  The original project can be found at
[Github](https://github.com/bradencarlson/sage-jupyter) and was originally written in SageMath in Jupyter Notebooks.

The original project was designed to be used in Jupyter Notebooks, but this package was later created for those who wish to 
easily use the functions in this project from a Sage Terminal.  

Please note that this package is **not** meant to be run in Python, but rather is meant to be run 
in a SageMath terminal.  Thus, while most of the functions defined in this project may 
work while run in Python, for full functionality, and for ease of use, SageMath is needed. 

The purpose of this project is to help students everywhere to understand topics taught in an undergraduate 
Abstract Algebra class by helping them to visualize these topics in SageMath.  The full project uses Jupyter Notebooks 
to help with this process, although all the functions defined in the original project can also be accessed here in this 
package.
