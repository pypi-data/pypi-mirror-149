releng-tool aims to provide a way to prepare a structured environment to
assist in the building of a project.

Overview
--------

When dealing with the release engineering of a project, assets may be found in
multiple locations and may require various methods to extract, build and more.
releng-tool can be used to process a defined set of projects/packages which
identify where resources can be fetched, how packages can be extracted and
methods to patch, configure, build and install each individual package for a
target root.

`releng-tool documentation`_.

Requirements
------------

* Python_ 2.7 or 3.4+

Host tools such as Git_, scp, etc. may be required depending on the project

client tool is required to perform said fetch).
