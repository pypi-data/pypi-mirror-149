# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a

# output value, and add a docstring for users.

    Parameters
    ----------
    options : List[dict]
        A list of dictionaries for the items to show as cards. Each dict has
        to contain a key: 'title' and optionally a 'description' and 'image'.
    default : str
        The default option to mark active if none was clicked so far
    spacing : int
        The spacing between the cards in px
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The index of the selected card in the passed options list.
