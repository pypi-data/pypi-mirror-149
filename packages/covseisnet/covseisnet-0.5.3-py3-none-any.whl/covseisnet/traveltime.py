        Parameters
        ----------

        stream: :class:`ArrayStream` or :class:`obspy.core.stream.Stream`
            The input data stream. It will attempt to load a traveltime grid
            for each trace in the stream.

        T_path: str
            Path to the travel time grids.

        identifiers: str, default
            Format of the travel time grid filenames. Defaults to "S" for using
            the station name as the filename. For situations where multiple
            traces have a common station name, use "NSL" which requires the
            network code, station name, and location code to all be present in
            the filename.
